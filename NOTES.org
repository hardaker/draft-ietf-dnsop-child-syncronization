    Abstract
    OLD
       This document specifies how a child zone in the DNS can publish a
       record to indicate to a parental agent that it may copy and process
       certain records from the child zone.  The existence of and value
       change of the record may be monitored by a parental agent and acted
       on as appropriate.

       It has been traditionally challenging for child DNS operators to
       update their delegation records within the parent's set in a timely
       fashion.

**** WONTDO In general, the inclusion of "zone" after "DNS" will help clarify.

       there a few places you were thinking of?

      I support the publication of this document, but I have one point that I
      would like to discuss.  I *think* this should be easy...

      Section 2.1.1.2.1 ends with this text:

         Specifically: a parental agent must not copy data blindly; An IETF
         proposed (or higher) standard specification must exist that defines
         how the data should be processed for a given bit.

      I am not sure how this gets enforced given its locality within the
      document.  I think it is easier to enforce by taking the text out of
      2.1.1.2.1 and adding text to the IANA Considerations section stating that
      in order to allocate a bit out of the Child Synchronization (CSYNC) Flags
      registry, the RFC needs to be published via Standards Action (per RFC
      5226). That would clearly control what type of document can get a bit
      allocated out of that registry.


      + WJH: Good point; changed to "Specifically: a parental agent must not copy data blindly
	and must understand the semantics associated with an bit in
	the Type Bit Map field that has been set to 1."


      + WJH: New IANA text: For new assignments to be made to this
        registry, a new RFC must be published via a Standards Action.

    The writeup and the document itself say that this is going to be
    Standards Track, which seems appropriate. But the datatracker says that
    it is going for Informational, the Last Call went out as Informational,
    and it is being balloted as Informational. If the intention is that this
    is Standards Track, this needs a new Last Call and needs to be on a new
    telechat. (For those that might be thinking that this is meaningless
    process-wonkery, please note that getting the status wrong has
    consequences: Barry and I split up Informational documents so only one of
    us reviews each. Therefore, Barry did not review this document at all. I
    am quite sure if this is to be Standards Track, he would want to review
    it.)

    + think this is done right?  (yep: aug 08)

******* DONE Good document. A few simple comments:

        Section 3:

          Require that the child zone administrator approve the operation
          through an out-of-band mechanism (such as through pushing a button
          via a web interface).  I.e., a parental agent MAY choose not to
          support the "immediate" flag.

        I think you reversed this sentence. Better would be:

          Choose not to process the CSYNC record immediately, even if the
          "immediate" flag is set. That is, a parental agent might require
          the child zone administrator approve the operation through an
          out-of-band mechanism (such as through pushing a button via a web
          interface).

        + WJH: suggested text added

******* DONE Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4: The MAYs in there MAY be inappropriate. The
	:LOGBOOK:

	:END:
    	ones about providing interfaces sure don't seem like protocol options. On
    	the others it's hard to tell. Please review. The SHOULD in 4.4 seems also
    	suspiciously wrong.

	+ WJH: I changed a few of the MAYs, but most seemed appropriate.
          The SHOULD on the documentation is somewhat important, as
          without documentation from the parental agent stating they
          support the CSYNC type, and how they're making use of it,
          clients have no way to know whether the protocol can be
          used.  There is no discovery that you get something good
          from your parent if you publish a CSYNC record.  The parent
          must document they're support for children to know they can
          make use of it.
