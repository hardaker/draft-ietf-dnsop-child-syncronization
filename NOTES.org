      I support the publication of this document, but I have one point that I
      would like to discuss.  I *think* this should be easy...

      Section 2.1.1.2.1 ends with this text:

         Specifically: a parental agent must not copy data blindly; An IETF
         proposed (or higher) standard specification must exist that defines
         how the data should be processed for a given bit.

      I am not sure how this gets enforced given its locality within the
      document.  I think it is easier to enforce by taking the text out of
      2.1.1.2.1 and adding text to the IANA Considerations section stating that
      in order to allocate a bit out of the Child Synchronization (CSYNC) Flags
      registry, the RFC needs to be published via Standards Action (per RFC
      5226). That would clearly control what type of document can get a bit
      allocated out of that registry.


      + WJH: Good point; changed to "Specifically: a parental agent must not copy data blindly
	and must understand the semantics associated with an bit in
	the Type Bit Map field that has been set to 1."


      + WJH: New IANA text: For new assignments to be made to this
        registry, a new RFC must be published via a Standards Action.

    The writeup and the document itself say that this is going to be

    it is going for Informational, the Last Call went out as Informational,
    and it is being balloted as Informational. If the intention is that this
    is Standards Track, this needs a new Last Call and needs to be on a new

    process-wonkery, please note that getting the status wrong has
    consequences: Barry and I split up Informational documents so only one of

          via a web interface).  I.e., a parental agent MAY choose not to
          support the "immediate" flag.

        I think you reversed this sentence. Better would be:

          Choose not to process the CSYNC record immediately, even if the
          "immediate" flag is set. That is, a parental agent might require
          the child zone administrator approve the operation through an

          The SHOULD on the documentation is somewhat important, as
          without documentation from the parental agent stating they
          support the CSYNC type, and how they're making use of it,
          clients have no way to know whether the protocol can be
          used.  There is no discovery that you get something good
          from your parent if you publish a CSYNC record.  The parent
          must document they're support for children to know they can
          make use of it.

      Revision reviewed: draft-ietf-dnsop-child-syncronization-01
      Summary: Ready with nits.
      ID Nits: Clean, other than a ref to a newer version of a draft (RFC Ed
      can deal with this).

      Checklist stuff:
      A.1.  Operational Considerations
      This document does describe how deployment will occur (it's basically
      built in to the document) and the solution is deployable.
      It appears to scale well from an operational / management perspective.

      A.1.5.1 - Will the new protocol significantly increase traffic load on
      existing networks?
      In a pathological network it could be noticeable - if you had a
      nameserver with a *very* large number of *very* unpopular names the
      CSYNC "polls" could be a significant fraction of traffic. This is very
      very unlikely to occur in the real world - nameservers like this (if
      they exist) are probably run by registrars ("Get free DNS when you buy
      a domain!") who would not need this functionality (they manage things
      in a different manner). They would also have other domains that get
      significant traffic, so the CSYNC would get lost in the noise
      anyway...

***** DONE A.1.8 - Are there fault or threshold conditions that should be reported?
      :LOGBOOK:
      - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2014-09-03 Wed 15:06]
      :END:
      Yes, kinda. Inability to process a CSYNC record (for any reason)
      should be reported. It would be nice to be able to signal that to the
      child, but there is no realistic way to accomplish this (which the
      document covers). I think that it would be useful for the document to
      suggest that failures SHOULD be logged (so that the parent can
      troubleshoot if they want to).

      + WH: added "Parental agents SHOULD, at a
	minimum, at least log errors encountered when processing CSYNC
	records.  "

      A.3:
      This document includes an Operation Considerations section (Section
      4). It is well written and understandable.
      Q: Does the proposed protocol have a significant operational impact on
      the Internet?
      A: Yup, it sure does -- deployment of this solution will significantly
      lessen delegation mismatches between parent and child. This will
      improve the stability / correctness of the DNS, and so the Internet at
      large.

      It says " If the SOA serial numbers are equal but less than the

      ignore the value in the SOA Serial Field.  Clients can set the
      field to any value if the soaminimum flag is unset, such as the

      TWO:
         For new assignments to be made to this registry, a new RFC must be

      Which is it: RFC Required, or Standards Action?  They are
      different (the former allows for Experimental or Informational
      RFCs, and RFCs in the Independent or IRTF streams; the latter
      requires a Standards Track RFC in the IETF stream).  There's

      interfaces sure don't seem like protocol options. On the others
      it's hard to tell. Please review. The SHOULDs in 4.1 and 4.4 seems
      also suspiciously wrong.


      Pete: last time I responded with the following comment.  Maybe it
      wasn't read, as the same comment is being repeated without a
      response to the following comment: 

  	+ WJH: I changed a few of the MAYs, but most seemed appropriate.
            The SHOULD on the documentation is somewhat important, as
            without documentation from the parental agent stating they
            support the CSYNC type, and how they're making use of it,
            clients have no way to know whether the protocol can be

            from your parent if you publish a CSYNC record.  The parent
            must document they're support for children to know they can
            make use of it.

     Since you added additional text addressing the API related concern,
     I changed one MAY to a "may" in the following sentence:

          -   <t>Parental agents MAY offer a configuration interface to allow
          +   <t>Parental agents may offer a configuration interface to allow
              child operators to specify which nameserver should be considered
              the master to send data queries too.

     The 4.3 section didn't have similar MAYs, so I didn't do
     anything about them.

     In 4.4, I made the following change:

          -  <t>The frequency with which they poll clients (which MAY
          +  <t>The frequency with which they poll clients (which may
             also be configurable by the client)</t>


     For the SHOULD in 4.1, I downcased it as well:

          - Parental agents SHOULD, at a
          + Parental agents should, at a
            minimum, at least log errors encountered when processing CSYNC
            records.

     For the SHOULD in 4.4, I didn't change it.  Because, as mentioned
     previously, publicly documenting the parameters is fairly
     important.

     Maybe these address your concerns?  Your previous comment was
     rather vague in exactly what your issues were, so I'm guessing at
     what you wanted done.

***** DONE Adding on to Ted's DISCUSS:

      The Security Considerations need to make clear that this
      mechanism MUST NOT be used to synchronize DS records between
      child and parent (whether this is allowed through the base
      protocol or some extension).  This is because the DS records are
      the only thing the parent has that allows it to validate all the
      DNSSEC signatures that it is required to verify -- if an
      attacker can change the DS record, then it can change any other
      record it wants to.

      WJH: Ok, I added the following two middle sentences, marked with

      use bits that aren't documented and the DS bit wasn't defined,
      but that being said: it's a good point that it should be well
      stated in the security considerations; thanks]

*** TODO Stephen Farrell

***** DONE 
      - general: Couldn't a child ask for its CSYNC record to be
      published in the parent? (and so on up...) I think you should
      say a parent MUST NOT take a child's CSYNC in the same way
      that you say to not use CSYNC for DS RRs.

      WJH: added a note mentioning that CSYNC, CDS, CDNSKEY records
      MUST NOT be synchronized.

      [note, however, that a parent publishing a CSYNC record at the
      parent *for the child* would certainly be interesting and really
      only affect broken resolvers that were willing to accept
      non-authoratative answers; none the less, I don't mind
      mentioning it]

***** DONE 
      - 2.1.1.2.1: Is the meaning of "blindly" sufficiently clear
      that all implementers and deployers will get this right?
      I'm willing to believe you if you say it is.

      WJH: made the following change, which seems sufficient?:

	-  Specifically: a parental agent must not copy data blindly
	+  Specifically: a parental agent must not just copy the data

***** TODO Point 1--

      2.1.1.1 doesn't talk about SOA serial number overflow.  It's not clear to me
      that the security goal intended by this section is correctly addressed if the
      implementation assumes that the comparison operators defined in section 3.2 of
      RFC 1982 are used, rather than doing a simple unsigned compare.

      I don't think there's a clearly correct answer here, but the issue should be
      documented and, ideally, a choice should be made.   To clear this DISCUSS, the
      document needs to say which of the two sets of comparison operators apply, and
      needs to explain how serial number wrap events are accounted for (or that they
      are not accounted for, and this is an open issue with security implications).

      The easiest way to fix this would be to require a comparison for equality, but
      I realize that this would place an additional burden on implementations which
      may be impractical.

***** DONE Point 2--

      In 3.2.1, you don't say what to do if the name server returns an NS record
      listing names queries on which result in NXDOMAIN, or for which neither A nor
      AAAA records exist.

      WJH: To the last paragraph of the NS section, I added two sentences:

        - 2 NS records").</t>
        + 2 NS records").  Parental agents MUST NOT perform NS updates
        + if there are no NS records returned in a query, as verified by
        + DNSSEC denial of existence protection.  This situation should
        + never happen unless the child nameservers are misconfigured.</t>

      WJH: and to the address section, added:

        - records for the child should be an empty set.
        + records for the child should be an empty set.  However, if the
        + end result of processing would leave no glue records present
        + in the parent zone for any of the of the in-bailiwick NS
        + records, then the parent MUST NOT update the glue address
        + records.  I.E., if the result of the processing would leave no
        + in-bailiwick A or AAAA records when there are in-bailiwick NS
        + records, then processing of the address records can not happen
        + as it would leave the parent/child relationship without any
        + address linkage.

***** Point 3--

      I don't think you've specifically excluded RRtypes not mentioned in section
      3.2.  It's seems obvious to me based on what's stated in section 2 that the
      intention of the document is to only support these two RRtypes, but I think it
      is necessary to say so explicitly, if that is in fact what is intended.   If
      something else is intended, text explaining what is intended should be added.  
      E.g., if it's okay for cooperating child name servers to set bits not listed
      here, and for cooperating parent name servers to process them, you should say
      so.

      WJH: This is stated, and I think you missed it.  Section
      2.1.1.2.1 (about the type bit map field) states (slightly
      different based on a comment from Stephen, who did see it):

	  Specifically: a parental agent must not just copy the data
	  and must understand the semantics associated with an bit in
	  the Type Bit Map field that has been set to 1.

      Let me know if you think this is insufficient.

***** DONE In 2.1.2, why SHOULD and not MUST here?

            Implementations that support parsing of presentation format
            records SHOULD be able to read and understand these TYPE
            representations as well.

      WJH: Because parsers don't necessarily need to understand the
      semantics of the record.  They just need to be able to keep
      reading and store the data.  Storing the data in ascii text is
      just fine if they're not going to process it in any other way.
      It'd be better if they understood it, but I can see cases where
      they don't full support everything (eg, new types listed even
      though they know some of them).

***** TODO In 3.2.1, what happens if the parent queries a host, and that host no longer
      appears in the updated NS record?   I think this is Mostly Harmless, but might
      be worth mentioning.   Also, in principle if the old server is left running but
      no longer authoritative, this whole scheme would fail if, for example, it had
      been the master prior to the change, were not configured to no longer serve the
      zone, and were no longer being updated.   This is probably worth mentioning as
      an operational consideration.
